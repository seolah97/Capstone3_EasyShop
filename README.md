# Capstone3_EasyShop

Used an existing coding project to experience one of the jobs a backend programmer may have.

Finished writing and implementing code for certain controllers class, as well as the mySQL classes.

Utilized postman by connecting it to the project by using the appropriate annotations.
	Tested the methods and queries to make sure they are working as intended. 
	Also used it to test for bugs.
